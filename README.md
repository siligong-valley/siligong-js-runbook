# Update slides for a meetup
Before running a meetup, update `src/data/meetup` 

# Start presentation deck
`yarn start`

# TODO
- add icons for community slide
- add cocktail icon to drinks slide
- add button & hotkey to fullscreen presentation
- add lines to favicon
- change meetup.com photo to logo?
- `react-typist` is being used for typing animation. It is unreliable & looks like no longer maintained. Recommend changing library.
